          <h1>Personal Information</h1>
          <p>
            My name is Justin Tubay and I was born in Charlotte, North Carolina.
            I am 18 and currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science. I
            like to code and learn new things, but I also like to spend time
            with my dog and work on my hobbies.

          <h1>Professional Information</h1>
          <p>
            I have been coding for roughly 3 years now, I started in high school
            and was set on practicing my skills with freelancing. I did
            freelancing until my freshmen year of college where I did an
            internship with LendingTree as a software engineer. I am going to be
            at Vanguard over the summer working as a software engineer again.

          <p>
            I mostly use Windows 10 for my operating system, however I switch
            between Windows and MacOS. I am currently taking Intro to Computer
            Networks, Database Design and Implemntation, Human Centered Design,
            Web App Design and Development and Western History Culture.

          <h1>Funny Story + Fun Fact</h1>
          <p>
            I used to hate programming, and even though I took computer science in High School I despised it.
            I one day came across Codecademy and learning website design rekindled my relationship with coding!
            A fun fact about me is I want to start a computer science vlogging channel.
