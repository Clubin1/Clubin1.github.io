              In North Carolina, licensed psychologists have a doctoral degree
              in psychology. After graduation from college, licensed
              psychologists spend an average of 7 years in graduate education,
              training, and research. As part of their professional training
              they complete a supervised clinical internship in a hospital or
              organized health setting, and at least one year of post-doctoral
              supervised experience before they can practice independently in
              any health care arena. Licensed psychological associates have a
              master's degree in psychology. They also have graduate-level
              training, a clinical internship, and post-graduate supervision.

              Once you have the name of several psychologists, there are several
              questions you'll want to ask, including:
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-1">
              Are you a licensed psychologist or licensed psychological
              associate? How long have you been practicing?
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-1">
              What areas do you specialize in? (such as family therapy, child
              psychology, adult psychotherapy, etc.)
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-1">
              What kind of treatment do you usually use, and why do you feel
              this would be effective for my situation? How long would you
              expect my treatment to last?
            </li>
            <li class="bullet-1">
              What are your fees? Do you accept my insurance or HMO coverage?
              Will you directly bill my insurance company? Do you have a sliding
              fee scale, or will you set up a payment plan?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="acc-btn">
          How can I choose a psychologist who is right for me?
        </button>
        <div class="acc-content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              First, gather information. Talk to your doctor or other health
              professionals. Today, many family practitioners work with a team
              of providers, including psychologists, and can refer you to one
              that they know and trust. Consult the department of psychology at
              a local college or university, or the local community mental
              health center. You could also ask a clergy member, as well as
              family members and friends who may know or have heard about
              individual psychologists in your community.

        <button class="acc-btn">How does therapy work?</button>
        <div class="acc-content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Therapy works by helping you look objectively at behaviors,
              feelings, and thoughts in situations that you find problematic. It
              helps you to learn more effective ways to deal with those
              situations.
              <br />
              <br />
              Therapy is a collaborative effort. You and your psychologist will
              identify your goals - what you want to have happen - and agree on
              how you'll know when you are making progress. Your psychologist
              will talk with you about the length of time it may take to help
              you see changes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Progress and change can happen. Nine out of ten Americans surveyed
              by Consumer Reports said that psychotherapy had helped them. And,
              in another recent major national study, half of the clients
              studied were making improvement after eight sessions of therapy,
              75% after six months of therapy.

        <div class="acc-content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              A psychiatrist is a physician (MD or DO) who completes medical
              school and an additional three or four year psychiatric residency,
              and is licensed to prescribe medications.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              Psychotherapists and counselors may have various kinds of training
              of varying quality. Some therapists/counselors have only a
              bachelor's degree, some have a master's degree, and some have a
              doctorate. A person who describes himself/herself as a
              "psychotherapist" is not necessarily a licensed psychologist.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <button class="acc-btn">
          Is therapy included in my health plan coverage?
        </button>
        <div class="acc-content">
          <ul>
            <li>
              Many health plans, including HMOs, provide some level of coverage
              for psychological services.
              <br />
              <br />
              If you do not have coverage and will be paying out of pocket, you
              can talk with your psychologist about sliding scale fees or
              working out a payment plan. Community mental health centers are
              also an alternative.
