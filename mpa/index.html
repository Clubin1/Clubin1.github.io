                  Welcome to the Mecklenburg

                  Directory. Search for specialities, location and name.

                  The Mecklenburg Psychological Association provides this
                  service as a way for you to find licensed psychologists in your
                  area. Using our search engine, you will receive a list of
                  psychologists whose self-described services match with your needs.
                  You may click on any psychologist's name to find out more about
                  that psychologist. Many psychologists have web pages that further
                  describe their services.
               </p>
               <p class="search-info">
                  You may want to contact at least three psychologists by phone
                  before making a decision about with whom you wish to schedule an
                  initial appointment. You may want to discuss how much experience
                  the psychologist has had with patients/clients with problems
                  similar to the one(s) you have, the cost of services, how
                  frequently you would be seen, the estimated length of treatment
                  and any questions you have about training or experience. If you
                  plan to use medical insurance to help cover the cost of therapy,
                  you may want to call your insurance company to understand your
                  mental health benefits, including co-pays and deductibles for in-
                  or out-of-network providers. Please consider that you may need to
                  leave a phone number and a time you can be reached in case the
                  therapist is unavailable when you call.
               </p>
